							<div class="intro"><p>In October 2019, ProPublica, a progressive news organization, contacted Quicken Loans requesting comment on a biased and factually inaccurate story regarding Dan Gilbert and the Rock Family of Companies’ involvement with Opportunity Zones. Over the course of 10 days, the Rock Family of Companies provided responses to ProPublica thoroughly explaining the truth about our role – or lack thereof – with Opportunity Zones in Detroit.</p>
							<p>To be clear, we vehemently disagree with the biased narrative put forth by the reporters of this story.</p>
							<p>This site serves as a formal response to the story and to set the record straight <span class="noBreak">on Opportunity Zones.</span></p></div>

Since moving to the city in 2010, the FOC have directly contributed more than $200 million to Detroit-based organizations and programming, while participating in more than 400,000 volunteer team member hours. Bedrock, and its affiliates, have invested and  <span style="font-weight: 900 !important; font-style: italic;">committed</span> more than $5.6 billion to acquiring and developing more than 100 properties, including new construction of ground up developments, in downtown Detroit. 
							<p>The Rock Family of Companies operate under a “For More Than Profit” philosophy, recognizing that businesses and community are inextricably linked. We have found that investing  directly into our great city has resulted in the most meaningful returns in education initiatives, housing stability, entrepreneurship programs and countless other areas.

							<div class="subheadIntro"><p>As we reviewed ProPublica’s inquiries, we immediately realized their fundamentally biased and incorrect understanding of not only the Rock FOC’s participation in the establishment of these Opportunity Zones, but how the process works altogether. Below are the full statements provided to ProPublica, which were not fully included in their piece.</p></div>

								<h2>Rock Family of Companies Responds<br /> to ProPublica Inquiries</h2>
								<p>“ProPublica’s misguided narrative regarding Dan Gilbert’s involvement in Opportunity Zones is completely without merit.  Claims that Dan, or any representative from the Rock Family of Companies, engaged in advocacy activities (monetary or otherwise) regarding the eligibility of certain areas to be designated as Opportunity Zones are completely false.</p>
								<p>The federal government — not the Rock Family of Companies— determined the eligibility based on technical criteria.  Moreover, Bedrock had no motive to see census tract 26163520800 made eligible.  The company had already purchased its assets well before the Opportunity Zones were even designated (as of Oct. 14) — there are no tax benefits.  ProPublica’s thesis that these properties would benefit from this tax treatment is utterly invalid.</p>
								<p>The program was developed to encourage private development in the nation’s most distressed areas.  Since moving downtown in 2010, we have invested more than $2.5 billion and committed almost $6 billion to projects in Detroit.  We are immensely proud of our record of investment, job creation, and philanthropy in both Detroit and Cleveland.  Contributing to those cities’ ongoing economic growth remains our top priority.”</p>

								<h2>Supplemental Statement</h2>
								<p>The Rock Family of Companies joined a wide range of stakeholders in providing feedback into the Opportunity Zone selection process. The State of Michigan engaged interested parties, asked for their input, and encouraged participants to share the State of Michigan’s request for input with other potentially interested groups.  This was an open process – it is utterly commonplace for the state to solicit feedback from economic development groups, private investors and municipalities regarding which areas have the greatest potential for economic development and investment. In fact, this is not only commonplace, but essential in order to make well-informed decisions.  Ultimately, the City of Detroit – not the Rock Family of Companies or any other respondent to the open call for comments – made the recommendations to the state about which census tracts in Detroit should be selected.</p>
									 
								<p>From a development perspective, it would be ludicrous if the city did not include tract 2080.  This tract encompasses half of downtown and the west riverfront, which are two high-priority areas for economic development.  ProPublica would do well to view major planning documents, including initiatives like the Detroit Future City, which identify these two regions as strategic areas of focus.</p>
									 
								<p>To be clear – the Rock Family of Companies did not exercise any inappropriate influence.  As previously stated, your thesis is misinformed.</p>

						<p>Established in the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Opportunity Zones offer incentives for patient (long-term) capital investments all over the nation in low-income communities in which investment has been sparse and growth of businesses has been minimal. There are three types of tax incentives that relate to the treatment of capital gains. Each of the incentives are connected to the longevity of an investor’s stake in a qualified Opportunity Fund, for 10 years or more.</p>
