									<h2>Rock Family of Companies Responds<br /> to ProPublica Inquiries</h2>
									<p>“ProPublica’s misguided narrative regarding Dan Gilbert’s involvement in Opportunity Zones is completely without merit.  Claims that Dan, or any representative from the Rock Family of Companies, engaged in advocacy activities (monetary or otherwise) regarding the eligibility of certain areas to be designated as Opportunity Zones are completely false.</p>
									<p>The federal government — not the Rock Family of Companies— determined the eligibility based on technical criteria.  Moreover, Bedrock had no motive to see census tract 26163520800 made eligible.  The company had already purchased its assets well before the Opportunity Zones were even designated (as of Oct. 14) — there are no tax benefits.  ProPublica’s thesis that these properties would benefit from this tax treatment is utterly invalid.</p>
									<p>The program was developed to encourage private development in the nation’s most distressed areas.  Since moving downtown in 2010, we have invested more than $2.5 billion and committed almost $6 billion to projects in Detroit.  We are immensely proud of our record of investment, job creation, and philanthropy in both Detroit and Cleveland.  Contributing to those cities’ ongoing economic growth remains our top priority.”</p>

									<h2>Supplemental Statement</h2>
									<p>The Rock Family of Companies joined a wide range of stakeholders in providing feedback into the Opportunity Zone selection process. The State of Michigan engaged interested parties, asked for their input, and encouraged participants to share the State of Michigan’s request for input with other potentially interested groups.  This was an open process – it is utterly commonplace for the state to solicit feedback from economic development groups, private investors and municipalities regarding which areas have the greatest potential for economic development and investment. In fact, this is not only commonplace, but essential in order to make well-informed decisions.  Ultimately, the City of Detroit – not the Rock Family of Companies or any other respondent to the open call for comments – made the recommendations to the state about which census tracts in Detroit should be selected.</p>
									 
									<p>From a development perspective, it would be ludicrous if the city did not include tract 2080.  This tract encompasses half of downtown and the west riverfront, which are two high-priority areas for economic development.  ProPublica would do well to view major planning documents, including initiatives like the Detroit Future City, which identify these two regions as strategic areas of focus.</p>
									 
									<p>To be clear – the Rock Family of Companies did not exercise any inappropriate influence.  As previously stated, your thesis is misinformed.</p>

Opportunity Zones act as a stimulus for businesses and individual investments in areas that will benefit tremendously from large scale projects through increased opportunities for housing and job growth.  The U.S. Treasure predicts more than 35 million Americans live in areas designated at Opportunity Zones.</p>
